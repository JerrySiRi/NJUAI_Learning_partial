    "Obesity has truly become a worldwide problem, affecting countries rich and poor. So just how many men, women, and children are overweight or obese? It’s a natural question-and a surprisingly hard one for researchers to answer. The problem’s vast. The data, from some regions, quite spotty. So projections from one group differ a bit from the estimates of another. But all point to tremendous increases in global obesity rates over the past three decades-and find that the epidemic shows no signs of abating without dedicated efforts to combat it (source: Harvard Medical School).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's focus on the obesity data files from the US CDC on 2008 (I don't have the most recent data..) to generate visualization and analysis for the obesity problem in the Stats - you've already learned how bad it is in the in-class practice.\n",

    "\n",
    "In 1600, William Gilbert hypothesized that the Earth itself was a giant bar magnetic and that this gave rise to the Earth's **magnetic field**!  If it were true - that the source of the magnetic field behaved like a giant bar magnet - then the **inclination** of the **magnetic field** would only vary as a function of latitude. \n",

If the field were generated by a bar magnet, then the **inclination** would be horizontal (0 $^\\circ$) at the equator and vertical ($\\pm 90 ^\\circ$) at the North and South poles. The geographic location where the inclination is zero is called the **Magnetic Equator**\n",

The WACCM code is now being run in real-time, driven by meteorological forecasts from NASA/GMAO GEOS-5. The model results are open for research and teaching, available at https://www.acom.ucar.edu/waccm/download.shtml.
