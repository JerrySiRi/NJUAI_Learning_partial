    "When you are doing a large amount of data analysis using a similar type of algorithms, you would probably expect that many bits of your Python code that you wrote can be re-used, so you don't need to start from scratch for every data set (may need some changes but the core codes are re-usable). For exmaple, in the US people uses Fahrenheit (F) for air temperatures while here we are more familiar with Celsius (C). So whenever you see temperatures in degrees F, you want to convert it to degrees C. This is where **functions** are useful. You can simply define a simple piece of Python code, assign it a name and specify a list of input arguments, then keep re-using it anytime you would like to convert F to C.   \n",

    "\n",
    "Before we start to learn popular Python modules, let's try something more fundamental - why do we need modules and how do you develop your own module (you probably don't need to do that for this course but it's always good to know the very basics for your future reference.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we have defined a couple of \"useful\" functions in the previous notebook, e.g., <span style=\"color:blue\">gimmepi</span>(), <span style=\"color:blue\">deg2rad</span>(), and <span style=\"color:blue\">SanDiego</span>() etc., What if you wanted to use those functions later in a different Jupyter notebook for your homework assignment? Of course you can re-define them by simply copy-paste to your new Jupyter notebook. But when you have more than 100 functions to copy-paste, it's not efficient and definitely a waste of time. Here when **modules** get handy.   \n",
    "\n",
    "So let's say I put those three functions in a new file called myfuncs.py and save it to the current directly where your Jupyter notebook files are located. To do this, you can click on the 'Home' button in you Jupyter notebook page, then go to the directory where your working notebook file is. Click on 'New' and choose Text File.\n",
